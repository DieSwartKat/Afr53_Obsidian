# Afrikaans 53 Bible Translation in Markdown

Simple Markdown files of all the bible verses in the Afrikaans 53 Bible Translation. 
The Markdown format of the Bible is based on the same format used by Joschua from the below video.

You can downloaded his version from the Obsidian forum at:

[Bible Study in Obsidian Kit Including the bible in markdown](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bible-study-in-obsidian-kit-including-the-bible-in-markdown/12503)

The API used for the bible content is from getbible.net

##### Versions:
[GetBible available translations](https://api.getbible.net/v2/translations.json)

I've included the code used to generate the bible. It's needs more work should you require to use it to download other bible versions.
