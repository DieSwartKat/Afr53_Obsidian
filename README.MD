# Afrikaans 53 Bible Translation in Markdown

Simple Markdown files of all the bible verses in the Afrikaans 53. 
The Markdown format of the Bible is based on the same format used by Joschua from the below video

[![Bible Study: How Joschua uses the LYT frameworks (Obsidian)](https://img.youtube.com/vi/=vxc6YbmpMNQ&t=325s/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxc6YbmpMNQ&t=325s)

His copy can be accessed from the obsidian forum at:

The API used for the bible content is from getbible.net
Versions:
[Getbible available translations](https://api.getbible.net/v2/translations.json)

I've included the code used to generate the bible. It's needs more work should you require to use it to download other bible versions.


## Installation
