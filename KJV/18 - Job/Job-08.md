###### v1
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
###### v2
How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
###### v3
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
###### v4
If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
###### v5
If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
###### v6
If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
###### v7
Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
###### v8
For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
###### v9
(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
###### v10
Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
###### v11
Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
###### v12
Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
###### v13
So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish:
###### v14
Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider’s web.
###### v15
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
###### v16
He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
###### v17
His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
###### v18
If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
###### v19
Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
###### v20
Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
###### v21
Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
###### v22
They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
