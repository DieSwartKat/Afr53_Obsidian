###### v1
But Job answered and said,
###### v2
Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
###### v3
For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
###### v4
For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
###### v5
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
###### v6
Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
###### v7
The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
###### v8
Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
###### v9
Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
###### v10
Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
###### v11
What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
###### v12
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
###### v13
Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
###### v14
To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
###### v15
My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
###### v16
Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
###### v17
What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
###### v18
The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
###### v19
The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
###### v20
They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
###### v21
For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
###### v22
Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
###### v23
Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
###### v24
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
###### v25
How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
###### v26
Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
###### v27
Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
###### v28
Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
###### v29
Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
###### v30
Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
