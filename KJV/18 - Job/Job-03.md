###### v1
After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
###### v2
And Job spake, and said,
###### v3
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
###### v4
Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
###### v5
Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
###### v6
As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
###### v7
Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
###### v8
Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
###### v9
Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
###### v10
Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
###### v11
Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
###### v12
Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
###### v13
For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
###### v14
With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
###### v15
Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
###### v16
Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
###### v17
There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
###### v18
There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
###### v19
The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
###### v20
Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
###### v21
Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
###### v22
Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
###### v23
Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
###### v24
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
###### v25
For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
###### v26
I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
