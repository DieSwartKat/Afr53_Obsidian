###### v1
Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
###### v2
What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
###### v3
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
###### v4
But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
###### v5
O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
###### v6
Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
###### v7
Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
###### v8
Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
###### v9
Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
###### v10
He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
###### v11
Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
###### v12
Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
###### v13
Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
###### v14
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
###### v15
Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
###### v16
He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.

Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
###### v19
Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
###### v20
Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
###### v21
Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
###### v22
Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
###### v23
How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
###### v24
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
###### v25
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
###### v26
For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
###### v27
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
###### v28
And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
