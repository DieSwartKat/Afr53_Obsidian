###### v1
Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
###### v2
Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
###### v3
My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
###### v4
The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
###### v5
If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
###### v6
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
###### v7
Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
###### v8
Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
###### v9
I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
###### v10
Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
###### v11
He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
###### v12
Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
###### v13
Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
###### v14
For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
###### v15
In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
###### v16
Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
###### v17
That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
###### v18
He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
###### v19
He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
###### v20
So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
###### v21
His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
###### v22
Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
###### v23
If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
###### v24
Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
###### v25
His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:
###### v26
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
###### v27
He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
###### v28
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
###### v29
Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
###### v30
To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
###### v31
Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
###### v32
If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
###### v33
If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
