###### v1
Furthermore Elihu answered and said,
###### v2
Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
###### v3
For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
###### v4
Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
###### v5
For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
###### v6
Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
###### v7
What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
###### v8
Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
###### v9
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
###### v10
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
###### v11
For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
###### v12
Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
###### v13
Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
###### v14
If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
###### v15
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
###### v16
If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
###### v17
Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
###### v18
Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
###### v19
How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
###### v20
In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
###### v21
For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
###### v22
There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
###### v23
For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
###### v24
He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
###### v25
Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
###### v26
He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
###### v27
Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
###### v28
So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
###### v29
When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
###### v30
That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
###### v31
Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
###### v32
That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
###### v33
Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
###### v34
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
###### v35
Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
###### v36
My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
###### v37
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
