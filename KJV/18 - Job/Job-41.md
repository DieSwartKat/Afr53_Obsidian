###### v1
Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
###### v2
Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
###### v3
Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
###### v4
Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
###### v5
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
###### v6
Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
###### v7
Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
###### v8
Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
###### v9
Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
###### v10
None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
###### v11
Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
###### v12
I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
###### v13
Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
###### v14
Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
###### v15
His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
###### v16
One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
###### v17
They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
###### v18
By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
###### v19
Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
###### v20
Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
###### v21
His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
###### v22
In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
###### v23
The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
###### v24
His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
###### v25
When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
###### v26
The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
###### v27
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
###### v28
The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
###### v29
Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
###### v30
Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
###### v31
He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
###### v32
He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
###### v33
Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
###### v34
He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
