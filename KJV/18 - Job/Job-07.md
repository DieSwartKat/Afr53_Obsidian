###### v1
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
###### v2
As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
###### v3
So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
###### v4
When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
###### v5
My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
###### v6
My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.
###### v7
O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
###### v8
The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
###### v9
As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
###### v10
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
###### v11
Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
###### v12
Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
###### v13
When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
###### v14
Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
###### v15
So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
###### v16
I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
###### v17
What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
###### v18
And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
###### v19
How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
###### v20
I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
###### v21
And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
