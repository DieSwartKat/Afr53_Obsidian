###### v1
Then Job answered and said,
###### v2
I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
###### v3
Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
###### v4
I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
###### v5
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
###### v6
Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
###### v7
But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
###### v8
And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
###### v9
He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
###### v10
They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
###### v11
God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
###### v12
I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
###### v13
His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
###### v14
He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
###### v15
I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
###### v16
My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
###### v17
Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
###### v18
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
###### v19
Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
###### v20
My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
###### v21
O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
###### v22
When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
