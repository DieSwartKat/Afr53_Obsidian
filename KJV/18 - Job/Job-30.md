###### v3
For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.

They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
###### v6
To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
###### v7
Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
###### v8
They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.

###### v11
Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.

Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
###### v13
They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
###### v14
They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
###### v16
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
###### v17
My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
###### v18
By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
###### v19
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
###### v20
I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
###### v21
Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
###### v22
Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
###### v23
For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
###### v24
Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
###### v25
Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
###### v26
When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
###### v27
My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
###### v28
I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
###### v29
I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
###### v30
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
###### v31
My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
