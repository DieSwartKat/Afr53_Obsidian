###### v1
Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
###### v2
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
###### v3
Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
###### v4
Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
###### v5
But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
###### v6
Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
###### v7
Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
###### v8
Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
###### v9
By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
###### v10
The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
###### v11
The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.
###### v12
Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
###### v13
In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
###### v14
Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
###### v15
Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
###### v16
It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
###### v17
Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
###### v18
Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
###### v19
How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
###### v20
They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
###### v21
Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
