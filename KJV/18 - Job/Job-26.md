###### v1
But Job answered and said,
###### v2
How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
###### v3
How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
###### v4
To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
###### v5
Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
###### v6
Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
###### v7
He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
###### v8
He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
###### v9
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
###### v10
He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
###### v11
The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
###### v12
He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
###### v13
By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
###### v14
Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
