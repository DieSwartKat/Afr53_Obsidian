###### v1
Then Job answered and said,
###### v2
Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
###### v3
Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
###### v4
I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
###### v5
I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
###### v6
Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
###### v7
There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
###### v8
Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
###### v9
On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
###### v10
But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
###### v11
My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
###### v12
Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
###### v13
But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
###### v14
For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
###### v15
Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
###### v16
For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
###### v17
Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
