###### v1
Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
###### v2
Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
###### v3
Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
###### v4
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
###### v5
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
###### v6
Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
###### v7
When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
###### v8
Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
###### v9
When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
###### v10
And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
###### v11
And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
###### v12
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
###### v13
That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
###### v14
It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
###### v15
And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
###### v16
Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
###### v17
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
###### v18
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
###### v19
Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
###### v20
That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
###### v21
Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
###### v22
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
###### v23
Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
###### v24
By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
###### v25
Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
###### v26
To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
###### v27
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
###### v28
Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
###### v29
Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
###### v30
The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
###### v31
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
###### v32
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
###### v33
Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
###### v34
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
###### v35
Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?
###### v36
Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
###### v37
Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
###### v38
When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
###### v39
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
###### v40
When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
###### v41
Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
