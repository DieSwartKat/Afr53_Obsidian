###### v1
I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
###### v2
For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
###### v3
Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
###### v4
Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
###### v5
If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
###### v6
Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
###### v7
If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
###### v8
Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
###### v9
If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;
###### v10
Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
###### v11
For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
###### v12
For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
###### v13
If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
###### v14
What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
###### v15
Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
###### v16
If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
###### v17
Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
###### v18
(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)
###### v19
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
###### v20
If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
###### v21
If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
###### v22
Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
###### v23
For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
###### v24
If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
###### v25
If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
###### v26
If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
###### v27
And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
###### v28
This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
###### v29
If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
###### v30
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
###### v31
If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
###### v32
The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
###### v33
If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
###### v34
Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
###### v35
Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
###### v36
Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
###### v37
I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
###### v38
If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
###### v39
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
###### v40
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
