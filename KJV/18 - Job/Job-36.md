###### v1
Elihu also proceeded, and said,
###### v2
Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.
###### v3
I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
###### v4
For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
###### v5
Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
###### v6
He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
###### v7
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
###### v8
And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
###### v9
Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
###### v10
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
###### v11
If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
###### v12
But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
###### v13
But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
###### v14
They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
###### v15
He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
###### v16
Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
###### v17
But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
###### v18
Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
###### v19
Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
###### v20
Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
###### v21
Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
###### v22
Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
###### v23
Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
###### v24
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
###### v25
Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
###### v26
Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
###### v27
For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
###### v28
Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
###### v29
Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
###### v30
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
###### v31
For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
###### v32
With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
###### v33
The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
