###### v15
Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
###### v16
Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:

Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
###### v18
Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
###### v19
The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
###### v20
Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
###### v21
Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
###### v22
Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
###### v23
If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
###### v24
Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
###### v25
Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
###### v26
For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
###### v27
Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.

When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
