My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
###### v2
Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
###### v3
Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
###### v4
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.

###### v6
He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
###### v7
Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.

Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
###### v9
The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
###### v10
But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.

###### v13
If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.

###### v16
They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
