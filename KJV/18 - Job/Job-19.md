###### v1
Then Job answered and said,
###### v2
How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
###### v3
These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
###### v4
And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
###### v5
If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
###### v6
Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
###### v7
Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
###### v8
He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
###### v9
He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
###### v10
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
###### v11
He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
###### v12
His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
###### v13
He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
###### v14
My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
###### v15
They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
###### v16
I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
###### v17
My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s sake of mine own body.
###### v18
Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
###### v19
All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
###### v20
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
###### v21
Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
###### v22
Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
###### v23
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
###### v24
That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
###### v25
For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
###### v26
And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
###### v27
Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
###### v28
But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
###### v29
Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
