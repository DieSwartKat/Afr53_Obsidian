###### v1
Now these are the nations which the Lord left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
###### v2
Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
###### v3
Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal–hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
###### v4
And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
###### v5
And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
###### v6
And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
###### v7
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
###### v8
Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan–rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan–rishathaim eight years.
###### v9
And when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.
###### v10
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the Lord delivered Chushan–rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan–rishathaim.
###### v11
And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
###### v12
And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.
###### v13
And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
###### v14
So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
###### v15
But when the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, the Lord raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
###### v16
But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
###### v17
And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
###### v18
And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
###### v19
But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
###### v20
And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
###### v21
And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
###### v22
And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
###### v23
Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
###### v24
When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
###### v25
And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
###### v26
And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
###### v27
And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
###### v28
And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the Lord hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
###### v29
And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
###### v30
So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
###### v31
And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
