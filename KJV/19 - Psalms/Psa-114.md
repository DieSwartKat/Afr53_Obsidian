###### v1
When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
###### v2
Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
###### v3
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
###### v4
The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
###### v5
What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
###### v6
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
###### v7
Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
###### v8
Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
