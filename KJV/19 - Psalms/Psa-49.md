###### v1
Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
###### v2
Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
###### v3
My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
###### v4
I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
###### v5
Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
###### v6
They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
###### v7
None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
###### v8
(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
###### v9
That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
###### v10
For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
###### v11
Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
###### v12
Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
###### v13
This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
###### v14
Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
###### v15
But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
###### v16
Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
###### v17
For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
###### v18
Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
###### v19
He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
###### v20
Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
