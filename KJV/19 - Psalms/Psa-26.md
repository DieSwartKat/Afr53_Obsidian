###### v1
Judge me, O Lord; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide.
###### v2
Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
###### v3
For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
###### v4
I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
###### v5
I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
###### v6
I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O Lord:
###### v7
That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
###### v8
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
###### v9
Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
###### v10
In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
###### v11
But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
###### v12
My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the Lord.
