###### v3

The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
###### v6
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.

I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.

Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
###### v10
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
