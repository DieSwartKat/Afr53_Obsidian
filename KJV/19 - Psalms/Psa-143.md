Hear my prayer, O Lord, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
###### v2
And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.

Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
###### v5
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
###### v6
I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
###### v7
Hear me speedily, O Lord: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
###### v8
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

Deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.

Quicken me, O Lord, for thy name’s sake: for thy righteousness’ sake bring my soul out of trouble.
###### v12
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
