###### v1
When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
###### v3
The Lord hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
###### v4
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south.
###### v5
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
###### v6
He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
