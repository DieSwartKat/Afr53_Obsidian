###### v1
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
###### v2
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.
###### v3
The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
###### v4
The Lord is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
###### v5
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
###### v6
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up:
###### v7
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
###### v8
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we bless you in the name of the Lord.
