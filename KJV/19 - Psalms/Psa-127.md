###### v1
Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
###### v2
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
###### v3
Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
###### v4
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
###### v5
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
