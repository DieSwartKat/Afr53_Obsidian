###### v1
I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
###### v2
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
###### v3
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,
###### v4
Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.
###### v5
Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
###### v6
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
###### v7
And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
###### v8
Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
###### v9
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
###### v10
Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
###### v11
When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.
###### v12
Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
###### v13
O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
