###### v1
Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
###### v2
Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
###### v3
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
###### v4
Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
###### v5
Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
###### v6
When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
###### v7
Our bones are scattered at the grave’s mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
###### v8
But mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
###### v9
Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
###### v10
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
