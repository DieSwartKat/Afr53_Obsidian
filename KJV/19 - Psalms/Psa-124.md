###### v1
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say;
###### v2
If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
###### v3
Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
###### v4
Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
###### v5
Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
###### v6
Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
###### v7
Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
###### v8
Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.
