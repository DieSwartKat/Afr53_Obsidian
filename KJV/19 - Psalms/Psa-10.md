###### v7
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
###### v8
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.

Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.

Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
