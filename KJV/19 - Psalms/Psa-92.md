###### v1
It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
###### v2
To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
###### v3
Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
###### v4
For thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
###### v5
O Lord, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
###### v6
A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
###### v7
When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
###### v8
But thou, Lord, art most high for evermore.
###### v9
For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
###### v10
But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
###### v11
Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
###### v12
The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
###### v13
Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God.
###### v14
They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
###### v15
To shew that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
