###### v1
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
###### v2
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
###### v3
Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
###### v4
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
