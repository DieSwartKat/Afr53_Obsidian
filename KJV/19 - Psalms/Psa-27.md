Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.

###### v5
For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.

Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.

Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.
