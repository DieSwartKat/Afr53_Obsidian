###### v1
Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
###### v2
I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
###### v3
I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
###### v4
They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
###### v5
O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
###### v6
Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
###### v7
Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
###### v8
I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s children.
###### v9
For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
###### v10
When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
###### v11
I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
###### v12
They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
###### v13
But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
###### v14
Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
###### v15
Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
###### v16
Hear me, O Lord; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
###### v17
And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
###### v18
Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
###### v19
Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
###### v20
Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
###### v21
They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
###### v22
Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
###### v23
Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
###### v24
Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
###### v25
Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
###### v26
For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
###### v30
I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
###### v31
This also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
###### v32
The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
###### v33
For the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
###### v34
Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moveth therein.
###### v35
For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
