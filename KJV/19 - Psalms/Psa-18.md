###### v1
I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.

###### v6
In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.

He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
###### v10
And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.

He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
###### v12
At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
###### v13
The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
###### v15
Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.

The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
###### v21
For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
###### v22
For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.

###### v24
Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
###### v25
With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
###### v26
With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the Lord, but he answered them not.
###### v42
Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
###### v43
Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
