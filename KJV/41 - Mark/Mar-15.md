###### v9
But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?

###### v11

###### v12
And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?

###### v14
Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.

###### v30
Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
###### v31
Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
###### v32
Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
###### v33
