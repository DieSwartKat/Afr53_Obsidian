###### v1
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish’s belly,
###### v2
And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.
###### v3
For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
###### v4
Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
###### v5
The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
###### v6
I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.
###### v7
When my soul fainted within me I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
###### v8
They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
###### v9
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the Lord.
###### v10
And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
