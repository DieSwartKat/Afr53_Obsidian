###### v1
From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
###### v2
Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
###### v3
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
###### v4
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
###### v5
Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
###### v6
But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
###### v7
Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
###### v8
Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
###### v9
Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
###### v10
Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
###### v11
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
###### v12
There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
###### v13
Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
###### v14
Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
###### v15
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
###### v16
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
###### v17
Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
