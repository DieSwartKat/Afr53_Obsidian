Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;

To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
###### v5
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
###### v6
If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
###### v7
For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
###### v8
But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
###### v9
Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
###### v10
For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
###### v11
Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
###### v12
One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
###### v13
This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
###### v14
Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
###### v15
Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
###### v16
They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
