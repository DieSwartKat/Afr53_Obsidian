But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

###### v11
And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai–roi.

###### v14
And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
###### v15
Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
###### v16
These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.

And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
###### v18
And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
###### v19
And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:
###### v20
And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan–aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
###### v21
And Isaac intreated the Lord for his wife, because she was barren: and the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
###### v22
And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the Lord.
###### v23
And the Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
###### v24
And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
###### v25
And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
###### v26
And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
###### v27
And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
###### v28
And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
###### v29
And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
###### v30
And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
###### v31
And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
###### v32
And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
###### v33
And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
###### v34
Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
