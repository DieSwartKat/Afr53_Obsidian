###### v1
What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
###### v2
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
###### v3
For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
###### v4
God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
###### v5
But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
###### v6
God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
###### v7
For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
###### v8
And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
###### v9
What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
###### v10
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
###### v11
There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
###### v12
They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
###### v13
Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
###### v14
Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
###### v15
Their feet are swift to shed blood:
###### v16
Destruction and misery are in their ways:
###### v17
And the way of peace have they not known:
###### v18
There is no fear of God before their eyes.
###### v19
Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
###### v20
Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
###### v21
But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
###### v22
Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
###### v23
For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
###### v24
Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
###### v25
Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
###### v26
To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
###### v27
Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
###### v28
Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
###### v29
Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
###### v30
Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
###### v31
Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
