###### v1
And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
###### v2
And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
###### v3
And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.
###### v4
Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
###### v5
And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
###### v6
When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.
###### v7
And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
###### v8
And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
###### v9
Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
###### v10
And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
###### v11
And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
###### v12
And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
###### v13
And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
###### v14
Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
###### v15
No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
###### v16
I will therefore chastise him, and release him. 
###### v17
(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
###### v18
And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
###### v19
(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
###### v20
Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
###### v21
But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
###### v22
And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
###### v23
And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
###### v24
And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
###### v25
And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
###### v26
And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
###### v27
And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
###### v28
But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
###### v29
For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
###### v30
Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
###### v31
For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
###### v32
And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
###### v33
And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
###### v34
Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
###### v35
And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
###### v36
And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
###### v37
And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
###### v38
And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
###### v39
And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
###### v40
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
###### v41
And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
###### v42
And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
###### v43
And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
###### v44
And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
###### v45
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
###### v46
And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
###### v47
Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
###### v48
And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
###### v49
And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
###### v50
And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
###### v51
(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
###### v52
This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
###### v53
And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
###### v54
And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
###### v55
And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
###### v56
And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
