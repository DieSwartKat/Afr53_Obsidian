###### v1
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
###### v3
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
###### v4
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
###### v5
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.
###### v6
For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
###### v7
And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
###### v8
Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
###### v9
In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
###### v10
And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
###### v11
(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
###### v12
Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
###### v13
So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
###### v14
I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
###### v15
Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
###### v16
I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.

I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
###### v18
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.

For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
###### v20
He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
###### v21
With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
###### v22
He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
###### v23
Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
###### v24
Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
###### v25
Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
###### v26
For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
###### v27
Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
