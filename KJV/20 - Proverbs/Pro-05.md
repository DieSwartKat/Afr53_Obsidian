###### v1
My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
###### v2
That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
###### v3
For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
###### v4
But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
###### v5
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
###### v6
Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
###### v7
Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
###### v8
Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
###### v9
Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
###### v10
Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
###### v11
And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
###### v12
And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
###### v13
And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
###### v14
I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
###### v15
Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
###### v16
Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
###### v17
Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.
###### v18
Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
###### v19
Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
###### v20
And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
###### v21
For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.
###### v22
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
###### v23
He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
