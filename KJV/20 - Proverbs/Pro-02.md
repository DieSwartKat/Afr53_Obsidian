###### v1
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
###### v2
So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
###### v3
Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
###### v4
If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
###### v5
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God.
###### v6
For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
###### v7
He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
###### v8
He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
###### v9
Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
###### v10
When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
###### v11
Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
###### v12
To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
###### v13
Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
###### v14
Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
###### v15
Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
###### v16
To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
###### v17
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
###### v18
For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
###### v19
None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
###### v20
That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
###### v21
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
###### v22
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
