###### v1
My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
###### v2
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
###### v3
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
###### v4
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
###### v5
Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
###### v6
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
###### v7
Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
###### v8
Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
###### v9
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
###### v10
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
###### v11
So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
###### v12
A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
###### v13
He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
###### v14
Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
###### v15
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
###### v16
These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
###### v17
A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
###### v18
An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
###### v19
A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
###### v20
My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
###### v21
Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
###### v22
When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
###### v23
For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
###### v24
To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
###### v25
Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
###### v26
For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
###### v27
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
###### v28
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
###### v29
So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
###### v30
Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
###### v31
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
###### v32
But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
###### v33
A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
###### v34
For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
###### v35
He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
