###### v2
Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.
###### v3
I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
###### v4
Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell?

###### v7
Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
###### v8
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
###### v9
Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.

There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
###### v15
The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:
###### v16
The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.
###### v17
The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
###### v18
There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
###### v19
The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
###### v20
Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
###### v21
For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:

For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
###### v23
For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
###### v24
There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
###### v25
The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
###### v26
The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
###### v27
The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
###### v28
The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.
###### v29
There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
###### v30
A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
###### v31
A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
###### v32
If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
###### v33
Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
