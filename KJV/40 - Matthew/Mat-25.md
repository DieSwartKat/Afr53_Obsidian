###### v1
Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
###### v2
And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
###### v3
They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
###### v4
But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
###### v5
While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
###### v6
And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
###### v7
Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
###### v8
And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
###### v9
But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
###### v10
And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
###### v11
Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
###### v12
But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
###### v13
Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
###### v14
For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
###### v15
And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
###### v16
Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
###### v17
And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
###### v18
But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.
###### v19
After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
###### v20
And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
###### v21
His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
###### v22
He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
###### v23
His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
###### v24
Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
###### v25
And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
###### v26
His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
###### v27
Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
###### v28
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
###### v29
For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
###### v30
And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
###### v31
When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
###### v32
And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
###### v33
And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
###### v34
Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
###### v35
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
###### v36
Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
###### v37
Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
###### v38
When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
###### v39
Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
###### v40
And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
###### v41
Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
###### v42
For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
###### v43
I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
###### v44
Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
###### v45
Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
###### v46
And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
