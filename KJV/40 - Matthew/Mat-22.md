###### v1
And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,
###### v2
The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,
###### v3
And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.
###### v4
Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.
###### v5
But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:
###### v6
And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.
###### v7
But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.
###### v8
Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.
###### v9
Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.
###### v10
So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.
###### v11
And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:
###### v12
And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
###### v13
Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
###### v14
For many are called, but few are chosen.
###### v15
Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.
###### v16
And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
###### v17
Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cesar, or not?
###### v18
But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
###### v19
Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.
###### v20
And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
###### v21
They say unto him, Cesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Cesar the things which are Cesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.
###### v22
When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.
###### v23
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
###### v24
Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
###### v25
Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:
###### v26
Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
###### v27
And last of all the woman died also.
###### v28
Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
###### v29
Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
###### v30
For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
###### v31
But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,
###### v32
I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
###### v33
And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
###### v34
But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.
###### v35
Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,
###### v36
Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
###### v37
Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
###### v38
This is the first and great commandment.
###### v39
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
###### v40
On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
###### v41
While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
###### v42
Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.
###### v43
He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,
###### v44
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?
###### v45
If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?
###### v46
And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
