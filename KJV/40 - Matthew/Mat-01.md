###### v1
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
###### v2
Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
###### v3
And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
###### v4
And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
###### v5
And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
###### v6
And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
###### v7
And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
###### v8
And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
###### v9
And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
###### v10
And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
###### v11
And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
###### v12
And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
###### v13
And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
###### v14
And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
###### v15
And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
###### v16
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
###### v17
So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
###### v18
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
###### v19
Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
###### v20
But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
###### v21
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
###### v22
Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
###### v23
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
###### v24
Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
###### v25
And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
