###### v1
Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,
###### v2
Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
###### v3
But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
###### v4
For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
###### v5
But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;
###### v6
And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.
###### v7
Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
###### v8
This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.
###### v9
But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
###### v10
And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:
###### v11
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
###### v12
Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?
###### v13
But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.
###### v14
Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.
###### v15
Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
###### v16
And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
###### v17
Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
###### v18
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
###### v19
For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
###### v20
These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
###### v21
Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.
###### v22
And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.
###### v23
But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
###### v24
But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
###### v25
Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
###### v26
But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.
###### v27
And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
###### v28
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
###### v29
And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.
###### v30
And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:
###### v31
Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
###### v32
Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
###### v33
And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?
###### v34
And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
###### v35
And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
###### v36
And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
###### v37
And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.
###### v38
And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.
###### v39
And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.
