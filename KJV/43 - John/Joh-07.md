###### v1
After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
###### v2
Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.
###### v3
His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
###### v4
For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
###### v5
For neither did his brethren believe in him.
###### v6
Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
###### v7
The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
###### v8
Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
###### v9
When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
###### v10
But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
###### v11
Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
###### v12
And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
###### v13
Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
###### v14
Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
###### v15
And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
###### v16
Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
###### v17
If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
###### v18
He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
###### v19
Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
###### v20
The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
###### v21
Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
###### v22
Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
###### v23
If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
###### v24
Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
###### v25
Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
###### v26
But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
###### v27
Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
###### v28
Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
###### v29
But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
###### v30
Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
###### v31
And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
###### v32
The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
###### v33
Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
###### v34
Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.
###### v35
Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
###### v36
What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
###### v37
In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
###### v38
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
###### v39
(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
###### v40
Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
###### v41
Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
###### v42
Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
###### v43
So there was a division among the people because of him.
###### v44
And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
###### v45
Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
###### v46
The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
###### v47
Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
###### v48
Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
###### v49
But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
###### v50
Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
###### v51
Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
###### v52
They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
###### v53
And every man went unto his own house.
