###### v1
When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
###### v2
(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
###### v3
He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.
###### v4
And he must needs go through Samaria.
###### v5
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
###### v6
Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
###### v7
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
###### v8
(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
###### v9
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
###### v10
Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
###### v11
The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
###### v12
Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
###### v13
Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
###### v14
But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
###### v15
The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
###### v16
Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
###### v17
The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
###### v18
For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
###### v19
The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
###### v20
Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
###### v21
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
###### v22
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
###### v23
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
###### v24
God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
###### v25
The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
###### v26
Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
###### v27
And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
###### v28
The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
###### v29
Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
###### v30
Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
###### v31
In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
###### v32
But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
###### v33
Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
###### v34
Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
###### v35
Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
###### v36
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
###### v37
And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
###### v38
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
###### v39
And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
###### v40
So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
###### v41
And many more believed because of his own word;
###### v42
And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
###### v43
Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
###### v44
For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
###### v45
Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
###### v46
So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
###### v47
When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
###### v48
Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
###### v49
The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
###### v50
Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
###### v51
And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
###### v52
Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
###### v53
So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
###### v54
This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.
