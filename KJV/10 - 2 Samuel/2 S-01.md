###### v1
Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
###### v2
It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
###### v3
And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
###### v4
And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
###### v5
And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
###### v6
And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
###### v7
And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
###### v8
And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
###### v9
He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
###### v10
So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
###### v11
Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
###### v12
And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
###### v13
And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
###### v14
And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord’s anointed?
###### v15
And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
###### v16
And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord’s anointed.
###### v17
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
###### v18
(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
###### v19
The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
###### v20
Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
###### v21
Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
###### v22
From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
###### v23
Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
###### v24
Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
###### v25
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.
###### v26
I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
###### v27
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
